# DataStructureProject

<p1>the data structure project simulates four different data structures</p1>
<br><br>
<p2>linked list</p2>
the elements of the linked list are stored in the nodes that contain the data and the linke of the next node
<p2>stack</p2>
the stack make the push and pop operations LIFO (Last In First Out)
<p2>queue</p2>
the stack make the push and pop operations FIFO (First In First Out)
<p2>tree</p2>
In this project we simulate a complet binary tree.
the root node and another node have two children at most.
we put the new node at the left as much as possible;
<br><br>
the language is java and the grafical librarie is AWT  (Abstract Window Toolkit)
